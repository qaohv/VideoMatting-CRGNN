### [Project Page]() | [Real Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/23uvsue5we7e7b5/AAB4GSSWIaKiSouvN3wuWiwWa?dl=0) | [Paper](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/papers/iccv2021_video_matting.pdf)


## Background

1. Create virtual env: ```python3 -m venv crgnn```
2. Activate virtual env: ```source crgnn/bin/activate```

## Installation
Our code has been tested on Python 3.7, cuda 10.1 and PyTorch 1.4.0.

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	# install dcn
	cd models/archs/dcn
	python setup.py develop

## Inference
Run the following command to do inference of CRGNN on the video matting dataset:

    python3 test.py --data-root ./examples --checkpoint ./checkpoint/e20.pth

## Data
1. Please see the real data in the above link.
2. Please contact Tiantian Wang (tiantianwang.ice@gmail.com) if you need composited data.
